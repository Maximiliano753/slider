                    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                    <p>Press Fire Games is a game dev studio with extensive experience in games and engine development. We create multiplayer shooter games and develop our own technologies.<br>
                        The best graphics on mobile devices and great gameplay are what we stick to and focus on.
                        We've developed our own cross-platform game engine that allows us to create games with excellent graphics and gameplay. Battle Prime is the first project we've developed on our engine. It is a mobile shooter with millions of app installs and an above 4.5 rating in the AppStore and Google Play.
                        And still we move on and create new projects.</p>
